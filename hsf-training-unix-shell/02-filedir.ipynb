    "# Navigating Files and Directories\n",
    "\n",
    "Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- Explain the similarities and differences between a file and a directory.\n",
    "- Translate an absolute path into a relative path and vice versa.\n",
    "- Construct absolute and relative paths that identify specific files and directories.\n",
    "- Use options and arguments to change the behaviour of a shell command.\n",
    "- Demonstrate the use of tab completion and explain its advantages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "- How can I move around on my computer?\n",
    "- How can I see what files and directories I have?\n",
    "- How can I specify the location of a file or directory on my computer?\n",
    "\n",
    "Instructor Note\n",
    "\n",
    "- Introducing and navigating the filesystem in the shell can be confusing. You may have both terminal and GUI file explorer open side by side so learners can see the content and file structure while they're using terminal to navigate the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "The part of the operating system responsible for managing files and directories\n",
    "is called the **file system**.\n",
    "It organizes our data into files,\n",
    "which hold information,\n",
    "and directories (also called 'folders'),\n",
    "which hold files or other directories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several commands are frequently used to create, inspect, rename, and delete files and directories.\n",
    "To start exploring them, we'll go to our open shell window.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's find out where we are by running a command called `pwd`\n",
    "(which stands for 'print working directory'). Directories are like *places* — at any time\n",
    "while we are using the shell, we are in exactly one place called\n",
    "our **current working directory**. Commands mostly read and write files in the\n",
    "current working directory, i.e. 'here', so knowing where you are before running\n",
    "a command is important. `pwd` shows you where you are:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "! pwd\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```output\n",
    "/Users/nelle\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here,\n",
    "the computer's response is `/Users/nelle`,\n",
    "which is Nelle's **home directory**:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Home Directory Variation\n",
    "\n",
    "The home directory path will look different on different operating systems.\n",
    "On Linux, it may look like `/home/nelle`,\n",
    "and on Windows, it will be similar to `C:\\Documents and Settings\\nelle` or\n",
    "`C:\\Users\\nelle`.\n",
    "(Note that it may look slightly different for different versions of Windows.)\n",
    "In future examples, we've used Mac output as the default - Linux and Windows\n",
    "output may differ slightly but should be generally similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also assume that your `pwd` command returns your user's home directory.\n",
    "If `pwd` returns something different, you may need to navigate there using `cd`\n",
    "or some commands in this lesson will not work as written.\n",
    "See [Exploring Other Directories](#exploring-other-directories) for more details\n",
    "on the `cd` command.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand what a 'home directory' is,\n",
    "let's have a look at how the file system as a whole is organized.  For the\n",
    "sake of this example, we'll be\n",
    "illustrating the filesystem on our scientist Nelle's computer.  After this\n",
    "illustration, you'll be learning commands to explore your own filesystem,\n",
    "which will be constructed in a similar way, but not be exactly identical.\n",
    "\n",
    "On Nelle's computer, the filesystem looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](fig/filesystem.svg){alt='The file system is made up of a root directory that contains sub-directories titled bin, data, users, and tmp'}\n",
    "\n",
    "The filesystem looks like an upside down tree. \n",
    "The topmost directory  is the **root directory**\n",
    "that holds everything else.\n",
    "We refer to it using a slash character, `/`, on its own;\n",
    "this character is the leading slash in `/Users/nelle`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside that directory are several other directories:\n",
    "`bin` (which is where some built-in programs are stored),\n",
    "`data` (for miscellaneous data files),\n",
    "`Users` (where users' personal directories are located),\n",
    "`tmp` (for temporary files that don't need to be stored long-term),\n",
    "and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "We know that our current working directory `/Users/nelle` is stored inside `/Users`\n",
    "because `/Users` is the first part of its name.\n",
    "Similarly,\n",
    "we know that `/Users` is stored inside the root directory `/`\n",
    "because its name begins with `/`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Slashes\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that there are two meanings for the `/` character.\n",
    "When it appears at the front of a file or directory name,\n",
    "it refers to the root directory. When it appears *inside* a path,\n",
    "it's just a separator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Underneath `/Users`,\n",
    "we find one directory for each user with an account on Nelle's machine,\n",
    "her colleagues *imhotep* and *larry*.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](fig/home-directories.svg){alt='Like other directories, home directories are sub-directories underneath \"/Users\" like \"/Users/imhotep\", \"/Users/larry\" or\"/Users/nelle\"'}\n",
    "\n",
    "The user *imhotep*'s files are stored in `/Users/imhotep`,\n",
    "user *larry*'s in `/Users/larry`,\n",
    "and Nelle's in `/Users/nelle`. Nelle is the user in our\n",
    "examples here; therefore, we get `/Users/nelle` as our home directory.\n",
    "Typically, when you open a new command prompt, you will be in\n",
    "your home directory to start.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's learn the command that will let us see the contents of our\n",
    "own filesystem.  We can see what's in our home directory by running `ls`:\n",
